Terms that you will in the description of the tanks:

APFSDS = Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot

HEATFS = High Explosive Anti Tank Fin Stabilized

HE = High Explosive

ATGM = Anti Tank Guided Missile

Tandem = double warhead (defeats ERA)

ERA = Explosive Reactive Armor (defeats HEAT shells) plus modern ERA like 4S22 Malachite, Monolith, Kontakt-5 and Relikt ERAs can help decrease the penetration of APFSDS rounds.

HEAT = High Explosive Anti Tank

APS = Active Protection System

Rifled =  The inside of the gun is grooved to make the shell spin a.k.a spin stabilized. Cannot fire ATGMs even if Russian.

Smoothbore = Allows faster rounds but doesn't make the shell spin which means it needs fins to stabilize it. Russian smoothbore cannons can fire ATGMs too.

Shells: tank rounds/bullets, just a fancy term for ammo used on tanks.

Depression: How much can the gun angle downwards (Russian tanks don't have very good depression)
